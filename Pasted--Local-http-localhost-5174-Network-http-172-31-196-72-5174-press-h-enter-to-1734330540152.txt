  You can mark the path "mock-aws-s3" as external to exclude it from
  the bundle, which will remove this error and leave the unresolved
  path in the bundle. You can also surround this "require" call with
  a try/catch block to handle this failure at run-time instead of
  bundle-time.

  You can mark the path "aws-sdk" as external to exclude it from the
  bundle, which will remove this error and leave the unresolved path
  in the bundle. You can also surround this "require" call with a
